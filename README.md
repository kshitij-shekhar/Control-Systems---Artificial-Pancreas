A closed-loop "artificial pancreas" system in Scilab/Xcos to regulate blood glucose levels in virtual diabetic patients. This project will involve creating physiological models of glucose-insulin dynamics and designing multiple control strategies, including PID and advanced algorithms (e.g., Model Predictive Control/Fuzzy Logic). It will incorporate realistic challenges such as sensor noise, communication delays, and inter-patient variability to assess controller robustness and performance. Key responsibilities will include system modeling, control algorithm implementation, simulation-based testing, comparative performance analysis (evaluating metrics like Time-in-Range and hypoglycemic risk), and iterative refinement to enhance glycemic control and safety.
